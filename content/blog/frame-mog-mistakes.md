# Frame Mog Mistakes: 12 Reasons You Keep Getting Frame Mogged

Most people don't lose the frame battle because of genetics.

They lose because of small, preventable mistakes.

If you've ever looked at a group photo and thought:

"Why do I look smaller than everyone?"

Chances are, one (or more) of these frame mog mistakes was happening.

Let's break them down.

If you need the full concept first, read: [Frame Mogged](/frame-mogged).

## Mistake #1: Slouching (Even Slightly)

This is the most common one.

Slouching:

- Compresses your clavicle width
- Rounds your shoulders
- Shrinks your silhouette

You might think you're standing straight.

You're probably not.

Quick fix:

- Roll shoulders back slightly.
- Keep chest open.
- Chin level.

Posture alone can prevent half of frame mog losses.

## Mistake #2: Standing Directly Next to the Broadest Guy

Contrast determines dominance.

If someone next to you has:

- 2+ inches wider shoulder span
- Noticeably thicker upper body

Standing perfectly aligned beside them amplifies comparison.

Fix:

- Stand slightly forward.
- Break alignment.
- Avoid shoulder-to-shoulder stacking.

## Mistake #3: Turning Inward Toward the Group

When you angle inward:

Your shoulders narrow visually.

This makes you look smaller than you are.

Fix:

- Angle slightly outward.
- Keep torso open.
- Maintain width.

## Mistake #4: Arms Glued to Your Torso

This compresses your frame dramatically.

Your silhouette becomes vertical instead of wide.

Fix:

- Slight gap between arms and body.
- Relax elbows.
- Avoid exaggerated flaring.

Small adjustment, big difference.

## Mistake #5: Leaning Into Someone Bigger

This is a dominance giveaway.

When you lean toward someone broader:

You shrink yourself visually.

Fix:

- Stay upright.
- Avoid collapsing toward larger frames.
- Maintain your own space.

## Mistake #6: Wearing Droopy or Ultra-Soft Clothing

Soft hoodies collapse shoulder shape.

Thin fabrics narrow your silhouette.

Fix:

- Wear structured outerwear.
- Choose thicker fabrics.
- Avoid overly slim sleeve cuts.

Clothing affects frame perception more than most realize.

## Mistake #7: Ignoring Shoulder Training

If you never train:

- Lateral delts
- Rear delts
- Upper back

Your silhouette remains narrow.

You don't need to be massive.

You need structured width.

## Mistake #8: Bulking Without Shape

Getting bigger isn't the same as improving frame.

If your waist grows along with shoulders:

You lose contrast.

Frame dominance rewards shape, not just mass.

Lean muscle > dirty bulk.

## Mistake #9: Standing Behind Everyone

Depth changes dominance.

Standing directly behind others:

- Makes you appear smaller.
- Shrinks perceived presence.

Fix:

- Stand slightly forward.
- Avoid full back row positioning when possible.

## Mistake #10: Over-Compensating

Some people try to overcorrect:

- Puff chest aggressively.
- Flare arms unnaturally.
- Lean forward excessively.

This looks try-hard and awkward.

Frame dominance works best when subtle.

## Mistake #11: Ignoring Waist-to-Shoulder Ratio

If your waist expands significantly:

Your shoulders look narrower by comparison.

Focus on:

- Maintaining moderate leanness.
- Core stability.
- Avoiding excessive midsection growth.

Contrast matters.

## Mistake #12: Not Understanding Relative Comparison

Frame mogging is relative.

You might look dominant in one group and average in another.

It depends on:

- Who you stand next to.
- How you position yourself.
- Lighting and camera angle.

Don't judge one photo in isolation.

## Why These Mistakes Are So Common

Most people:

- Don't think about posture.
- Don't understand silhouette geometry.
- Don't realize contrast amplifies differences.

Frame mogging feels harsh — but most losses are preventable.

## Quick Frame Mog Reset Checklist

Before any group photo:

- Stand upright.
- Square shoulders.
- Create slight arm separation.
- Avoid inward angles.
- Don't stack perfectly beside the biggest guy.
- Stay relaxed.

That's it.

Simple awareness changes outcomes.
