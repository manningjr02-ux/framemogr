# Frame Mog Examples (With Analysis): What It Actually Looks Like

It's one thing to understand the definition.

It's another to see it happen.

Most people don't realize they got frame mogged until they look at a photo and think:

"Why do I look smaller than everyone?"

This article breaks down realistic frame mog examples, explains why they happen, and shows what could've been done differently.

If you need the full concept explained first, read: [Frame Mogged](/frame-mogged).

## Example 1: The Broad Shoulder Contrast

### The Setup

Three friends standing shoulder-to-shoulder.

**Friend A:**

- Trains shoulders consistently
- Stands upright
- Chest open

**Friend B:**

- Slight slouch
- Narrower delts
- Arms pinned to torso

**Friend C:**

- Average build
- Slight inward angle

### What Happens

Friend A visually dominates.

**Why?**

- His shoulders extend beyond the others.
- His silhouette is clean and squared.
- The others compress their width.

### What Could've Helped B and C

- Stand slightly forward.
- Separate arms from torso.
- Correct posture.
- Angle slightly outward.

Frame dominance is often positioning + structure combined.

## Example 2: Tall but Collapsed

### The Setup

Tall guy in center of group.

- 6'2
- Slim build
- Leaning down slightly
- Rounded shoulders

Next to him:

- 5'10
- Broad shoulders
- Upright posture

### What Happens

The shorter guy appears more dominant in the frame.

Height is neutralized by posture.

The taller guy's slouch collapses his silhouette.

This is one of the most common TikTok "he got frame mogged" moments.

Height without posture fails.

## Example 3: The Forward Position Advantage

### The Setup

Two similar builds.

- One stands half-step closer to camera.
- One stands directly aligned with group.

### What Happens

The one closer to camera appears:

- Slightly larger
- More present
- More dominant

Depth amplifies silhouette.

It's subtle — but your brain registers it.

Standing slightly forward is one of the easiest frame mog tactics.

## Example 4: The Jacket Effect

### The Setup

Two average-build guys.

One wears:

- Structured denim jacket

The other wears:

- Soft hoodie

### What Happens

The structured jacket holds shoulder shape.

The hoodie collapses shoulder line.

Result: Jacket guy looks broader.

Clothing structure changes perception dramatically.

## Example 5: The Arm Position Mistake

### The Setup

**Person A:**

- Arms glued to torso

**Person B:**

- Slight space between arms and body

### What Happens

Person B looks wider.

Person A looks compressed.

Tiny positioning changes affect frame dominance.

## Example 6: The Lean Waist Contrast

### The Setup

Two guys with similar shoulder width.

One:

- Lean waist
- Clear V-taper

Other:

- Slightly higher body fat
- Less contrast

### What Happens

The leaner guy looks broader — even if actual shoulder width is similar.

Contrast amplifies frame.

That's why waist-to-shoulder ratio matters so much.

## Example 7: The Extreme Contrast Scenario

### The Setup

Very narrow build stands directly beside very broad build.

Perfect alignment.

No depth variation.

### What Happens

The narrower person gets completely frame mogged.

Not because they're unattractive.

Because contrast is brutal when perfectly aligned.

### Solution

- Change position.
- Stand slightly forward.
- Angle outward.
- Break symmetry.

## What All Frame Mog Examples Have in Common

- Relative comparison.
- Contrast.
- Silhouette geometry.
- Posture influence.
- Positioning impact.

It's never just one factor.

## Why People Search "Frame Mog Examples"

They want proof.

They want to see:

- Is this real?
- Am I imagining it?
- Why does he always look bigger?

Examples make the concept tangible.

Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

## How to Analyze Your Own Example

Look at group photos and ask:

- Who has the widest silhouette?
- Who stands upright?
- Who stands forward?
- Who compresses inward?
- Who has shoulder-to-waist contrast?

Then compare.

Or skip guessing and use structured analysis: [Frame Mog Calculator](/frame-mog-calculator).

It breaks down structural dominance more objectively.

## The Real Takeaway

Frame mogging isn't mystical.

It's geometry + contrast.

You don't need elite genetics.

You need:

- Strong posture
- Decent shoulder width
- Strategic positioning
- Awareness

Most frame losses are preventable.
